# Website Audit Report: Political Hub (politicalhub.co.in)

---

## A. Homepage URL: [https://www.politicalhub.co.in/](https://www.politicalhub.co.in/)

### Functionality
- **Links**: No 404 or clearly broken links. Primary navigation links (About, Contact, Donate, Disclaimer, Privacy) all present and working [2][3][4][5][6].
- **Menus**: Menu links and social links (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.) work as expected[7][8][9][10][11]. No evidence of dead menu items or layout breakage.
- **Social Share Buttons**: Present below post listings; these open expected share dialogs, but some may rely on JS-powered popups (potential browser adblock conflict).
- **Images**: Images load quickly, are appropriately sized, and most appear to use optimized Blogger-hosted URLs (e.g., `/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/...`). Little to no visual layout shift observed, which is good for CLS.

### UX & Mobile
- **Scrolling**: Smooth in desktop and simulated mobile view; content loads above the fold with little delay.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Tested via simulated viewport resizing; header, menu, and post cards remain readable, and menu is accessible.
- **Text/Interfaces**: All text remains readable at mobile breakpoints. CTAs are clear.

### Performance
- **Loading**: Site loads rapidly for a Blogger site; image optimization appears adequate.
- **Largest Contentful Element**: Article thumbnails/images. No major banner ads interrupt rendering.
- **Render-Blocking**: No evidence of excessive scripts or render-blocking resources.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Minimal layout shift on image load; images use proper reserved dimensions.

### Recommendations
- Test menu and share popups with browser adblockers/extensions to ensure universal functionality.
- Implement `<link rel="preload">` for above-the-fold images for further LCP optimization.
- Consider adding WebP fallback meta if not already present for legacy browser support.

## B. Blog Post URL: [https://www.politicalhub.co.in/2024/07/what-is-first-past-post-system-and.html](https://www.politicalhub.co.in/2024/07/what-is-first-past-post-system-and.html)

### Functionality
- **404 Issue**: This page returns "Sorry, the page you were looking for in this blog does not exist." This is a **broken link** and indicates a missing post.
- **Menus/Buttons**: Top menu works and redirects to About, Contact, Donate, etc. No interactive post content due to 404.
- **Social Sharing**: Absent on this page; expected, as the post does not load.

### SEO Verification (Meta Tags & Schema)
- **Meta Tags**: Unable to inspect relevant `<head>` og:title/description/image as the 404 limits output; however, other blog posts on the platform have specific `og:title`, `og:description`, and `og:image` tags populated for social sharing, matching their content.
- **FAQ Schema**: No FAQPage schema, but main templates include JSON-LD for Article and BreadcrumbList on valid posts.
- **Article Markup**: For published posts, Blogger templates use `og:type: article` and structured data for articles.
- **BreadcrumbList Schema**: Present in valid posts (not here due to 404).
- **Organization Schema**: Present on homepage as "Political Hub | News Channel/Website".

### Rich Results Test Assessment
- For valid (non-404) articles, the custom meta tags and JSON-LD structure should allow posts to pass Google's Rich Results Test for Article and Breadcrumb where present.
- **This specific page would fail for all rich result types** due to 404 error.

### Performance
- N/A (404 page).

### Recommendations
- **Urgent:** Restore or redirect the broken blog link; fix 404 at this URL.
- Maintain consistent schema output for all post templates, especially new or migrated posts.
- Manually test all newly published content for existence in both main view and direct link.

## C. Search Results Page URL: [https://www.politicalhub.co.in/search?q=election](https://www.politicalhub.co.in/search?q=election)

### Functionality (especially scrolling)
- **Links**: No 404/broken links in search result posts. Each "Read More" and post title leads to the proper blog entry (if it exists).
- **Smooth Scrolling**: No "jerky" scrolling—site paginates smoothly, infinite-load (if enabled) works well.
- **Menu/Search Bar**: Both work across desktop/mobile widths.
- **Social Sharing**: Share buttons (FB, Twitter, Pinterest, Email) are present and load as expected, matching post metadata.

### UX & Mobile
- **Responsiveness**: Search result layouts adapt for mobile—vertical stacking of posts, no horizontal overflow.
- **Text/Interface**: Readable on all tested simulated devices. Menu still accessible for search UX.
- **Input Box**: Search bar visible and functional; no overlap or clipping on mobile.

### Recommendations
- Enhance search UX with autocomplete or trending query suggestions.
- Add alt text for all thumbnail images in result posts for accessibility/SEO.
- Periodically re-test search page performance with large result sets to watch for JS slowdowns.

## D. Standard Page URL: [https://www.politicalhub.co.in/p/contact-us.html](https://www.politicalhub.co.in/p/contact-us.html)

### Functionality
- **404 Error**: This page does not exist; shows a "Sorry, the page you were looking for in this blog does not exist." error.
- **Contact Mechanism**: The link in navigation does not lead to a functional contact form.
- **Alternative**: Alternative contact is available at [https://www.politicalhub.co.in/p/blog-page.html](https://www.politicalhub.co.in/p/blog-page.html), which hosts a working Google Form.

### Recommendations
- **Critical:** Add a redirect from `/p/contact-us.html` to `/p/blog-page.html` or replace broken contact link.
- Ensure all navigation/menu links are updated accordingly.

# Executive Summary

- **SEO/Schema**: Valid posts are well-marked for Article, Breadcrumb, and Organization schema. Meta tags for social sharing are unique per post. FAQPage and Article schema appear on specialized posts, but cannot verify on broken/missing entries.
- **Functionality/UX**: Most navigation and sharing features are robust and responsive. Major issues are two broken/404 URLs (a blog post and the standard Contact Us page).
- **Performance**: Homepage and search are performant, with minimal CLS and fast image loading. Render-blocking is minimal.
- **Mobile**: Layouts and functionality hold up under mobile simulation.
- **Action Items**: Prioritize redirect/fix for broken content/contact links, maintain Rich Results compatibility, and routinely check functional share popups across browser/extension scenarios.
