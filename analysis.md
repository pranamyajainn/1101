Technical Audit of PoliticalHub Blogger Template (September 2025)
Overall summary & critical issue fix

Root cause of Telegram title issue – The Blogger template hard‑codes the <meta property="og:title"> tag to use the blog’s name (data:blog.title) for every page. As a result, Telegram and other social platforms pick up the generic site name Political Hub when a post is shared, instead of the specific article title. The correct page‑specific title is present in the page content (e.g., the article “Tulsi Gabbard and Kristi Noem Visit DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis in Washington D.C.” appears as the main heading
politicalhub.co.in
), but that heading is never bound to <meta property="og:title">. Thus, the Open Graph metadata fails to represent the individual post.

Required code fix – wrap the Open Graph and Twitter tags in a conditional so that single‑post pages output the post title and description, while other page types keep the blog‑level metadata. Replace the existing static <meta property='og:title'> tag with the following snippet (placed in the <head> before other scripts):

<!-- Fix for Open Graph title/description on single posts -->
<b:if cond='data:view.isSingleItem'>
  <meta expr:content='data:view.title.escaped' property='og:title'/>
  <meta expr:content='data:view.description.escaped' property='og:description'/>
<b:else/>
  <meta expr:content='data:blog.title' property='og:title'/>
  <meta expr:content='data:blog.metaDescription' property='og:description'/>
</b:if>


This change ensures that social platforms will pull the correct post title and description from single‑item pages and will fix the Telegram sharing bug.

Part 1 – Detailed code audit findings
Priority	Issue description	Location (code snippet)	Recommended fix
Critical	Incorrect og:title binding – the template currently sets <meta property='og:title' expr:content='data:blog.title'/>, causing every page to use the blog’s name rather than the post title. On posts this results in the wrong title when shared.	<meta expr:content='data:blog.title' property='og:title'/> in <head>	Replace with a conditional that outputs data:view.title.escaped and data:view.description.escaped for single‑post pages and falls back to the blog title/description for other page types (see fix in summary).
High	og:description also bound to blog meta – similar to og:title, the description is set with data:blog.metaDescription, so post snippets are never used.	<meta expr:content='data:blog.metaDescription' property='og:description'/>	Add the same conditional structure as above. Use data:view.description.escaped (or data:post.snippet) on single posts to provide a post‑specific description.
High	Open Graph image conditional bug – the og:image tag is wrapped in nested <b:if>/<b:elseif> blocks, but the second <b:elseif> is self‑closed (<b:elseif cond='data:widgets'/>). The subsequent <b:loop> and the final branch may be outside any condition, resulting in duplicate <meta property='og:image'> tags or no image on some pages.	Head section around the image meta logic	Rework the conditional: check data:view.featuredImage, else check data:blog.postImageUrl, else fall back to a default logo. Ensure each branch contains its own og:image and twitter:image tags and close <b:elseif> properly.
High	Missing Article/Breadcrumb schema – the template only outputs a WebSite JSON‑LD block and an empty placeholder for FAQ schema. There is no static Article or NewsArticle schema for posts, and no BreadcrumbList. Search engines may be unable to extract structured data.	<script type='application/ld+json'>… "@type": "WebSite" … in head; empty <script id='faq-schema-generator' type='application/ld+json'></script>; no article schema.	Create a static JSON‑LD block for NewsArticle on single‑item pages (with headline, description, author, datePublished/Modified, image, publisher, etc.) and add a BreadcrumbList with links for post→category→home. Avoid generating schema via JavaScript; output the JSON‑LD directly in the HTML.
Medium	Canonical URL duplication – two <link rel='canonical'> tags are present: one uses data:blog.canonicalUrl and another hardcodes https://www.politicalhub.co.in/?m=1. Duplicate canonicals can confuse crawlers.	Two <link rel='canonical'> elements in head	Remove the hard‑coded canonical; rely on the dynamic canonical or provide a single canonical per page type.
Medium	Placeholder meta values – the template leaves YOUR_PINTEREST_VERIFICATION_CODE in the p:domain_verify meta, which exposes unfinished setup.	<meta content='YOUR_PINTEREST_VERIFICATION_CODE' name='p:domain_verify'/>	Remove the placeholder or replace it with the actual Pinterest verification code.
Medium	FAQ schema generation relies on client‑side JavaScript – the <script id='faq-schema-generator' type='application/ld+json'></script> is empty. Later JavaScript populates it by scanning the DOM. Many crawlers do not execute JS, so FAQPage schema may never be indexed.	Empty script tag with id faq-schema-generator; JS function near line 6600 generates JSON.	During server‑side rendering, construct the FAQPage schema from data:post variables and insert it directly in the HTML. Avoid reliance on JS for schema injection.
Medium	Synchronous external scripts in <head> – //cdn.letreach.com/js/main/… and some other third‑party scripts are loaded without async or defer, blocking first paint.	<script src='//cdn.letreach.com/js/main/...'></script> in head	Add async defer to non‑essential scripts or move them just before </body> to reduce render‑blocking.
Medium	Image handling could be improved – while many images use loading="lazy", there are no srcset/sizes attributes or modern formats such as WebP/AVIF for responsive delivery.	<img> tags throughout template	Use srcset and sizes with picture elements to supply WebP/AVIF alongside JPEG. Assign fetchpriority="high" on above‑the‑fold images and keep loading="lazy" on below‑the‑fold assets.
Low	Search‑page scroll fix is redundant – the CSS fix for “unstick scrolling on search results” sets overflow:auto !important on both body.search-view and html elements. This may conflict with global styles.	CSS block around body.search-view	Confirm if the extra html rule is necessary; reduce specificity and avoid !important if possible.
Part 2 – Live website verification findings (6 Sep 2025)
1. Homepage – https://www.politicalhub.co.in/

SEO verification: The homepage loads successfully via a mobile‑optimized feed. The main heading shows the blog name Political Hub and tagline “Bringing you news breaks & exclusive political content”
politicalhub.co.in
. Posts appear with their proper titles and excerpts, but because the template always sets og:title to the blog name (see code audit), sharing any homepage URL will produce the generic title rather than the post headline. The page contains no visible structured data beyond standard Blogger markup.

Functionality/UX: The page lists posts with images and “Read more” links. No navigation issues were observed. A push‑notification opt‑in appears immediately, which may annoy users. The search bar is available and accessible. Because JavaScript is limited in this environment, we could not verify interactive elements or the scrolling fix.

Performance: The homepage loads numerous images and advertisements. Most <img> tags use loading="lazy", which is good, but external scripts like LetReach are loaded synchronously in the head. Ads load early and may cause layout shifts (CLS). No metrics were measured, but render‑blocking scripts and large images likely impact Core Web Vitals.

2. Sample blog post with FAQ – https://www.politicalhub.co.in/2025/09/tulsi-gabbard-and-kristi-noem-visit-dhs.html

SEO verification: The page title and heading are clearly present in the content
politicalhub.co.in
. However, the Open Graph tags still draw the og:title from the blog name, not the post. og:description similarly uses the site’s meta description. There is no static Article or Breadcrumb JSON‑LD; only the WebSite schema is output. The FAQ section is rendered at the bottom of the article and contains a list of questions and answers, but the FAQPage schema is injected via JavaScript and may not be visible to search engines. Alt attributes are present on images. Twitter Cards appear to use data:view.title.escaped, so sharing on Twitter may work correctly.

Functionality/UX: The article loads with hero image and content. A “Support Us” call‑to‑action and comment section appear after the FAQs. From our limited test, there were no broken links. Some pop‑ups (ads, push notifications) could interfere with reading. On mobile, content may be obscured by ads.

Performance: Images are large and loaded without modern formats. Ads and scripts (Disqus, LetReach, Flipkart widget) may block rendering. There is no explicit fetchpriority attribute on the hero image, so LCP may be slower than necessary.

3. Search results page – https://www.politicalhub.co.in/search?q=politics

SEO verification: Access to the search page through this environment was limited, but the code audit shows that there are no search‑specific Open Graph tags or schema. The <body class='search-view'> triggers CSS that adjusts scrolling. The canonical URL may incorrectly point to the mobile version if duplicates remain.

Functionality/UX: The CSS rule body.search-view { overflow:auto !important; height:auto !important; max-height:none !important; } intends to fix “sticky” scrolling on search results pages. Without live testing we cannot confirm its effectiveness. Ensure infinite scroll or manual pagination behaves as expected.

Performance: Search pages can load many snippets; ensure that results are paginated and images are lazy‑loaded. Avoid injecting heavy ads into the results list.

Conclusion

The static Blogger template used on Political Hub was recently updated but still contains several important issues. The most urgent is the incorrect binding for og:title and og:description, which causes Telegram and other social platforms to display the site’s name instead of post titles. Implementing the conditional meta logic described above will resolve the social‑sharing bug. Additionally, implementing proper Article/Breadcrumb schema, cleaning up conditional logic for images, and optimizing script loading will improve search engine visibility and performance.
